My Tester's Portfolio


## About me
My name is Natalia Plata. I am master of Mechanics and Machine Design and engineer of Biomedical Engineering. I graduated from Cracow University of Technology. I have been working as a mechanical designer in the R&D department for four years.

I would like to change my professional life therefore I have became interested in software testing. I have already taken first steps to develop knowledge and technical skills in testing. I am sure I will move forward quickly.

As for my experience which is useful in the work of a tester I have been working with Jira and Confluence software and so I know this environments satisfactorily. Moreover I have been working in multidisciplinary team in SCRUM methodology (team included testers and developers) therefore I am familiar with Scrum rules and way of work.

I currently know quite a few tools to testing and I have necessary technical and analytical skills to become a good software tester.
I independently have learned the ISTQB syllabus - basic level, I have learned to write test cases, report bugs and how to use the tools listed below. I am broadening my knowledge of MySQL and I am participating in uTest Academy now.
I offer an analytical skils, learn quickly, exceptional attention to details and desire to achieve high level of accuracy. I am able to organize my own work. I consider myself determined to solve problems, also in non-obvious ways. Testing challenges me and makes me want to learn more every day. I hope we can talk more about this at the interview :)

On this page I would like to share my experience gained through self-study.
